Powerful Prompt for AI Website Builder
Objective:
Create an interactive, visually impressive webpage using CANVAS (or similar) that presents two parallel learning journeys for AI capability development:

AI Champion Capability Roadmap (full journey, detailed chapters and subchapters)
Fast Track Leadership Team Roadmap (condensed journey, fewer chapters/subchapters)
All data must be synthetic and anonymized.


1. Website Structure & Streams


Homepage:

Hero section with dynamic visuals (animated, bold colors, “wow” effect)
Brief intro: “Explore two transformative AI learning journeys—choose your path!”



Stream Selector:

Interactive toggle or tabs:

“AI Champion Journey”
“Fast Track Leadership Team Journey”





Journey Pages:

For each stream, display a roadmap as a horizontal or vertical timeline (use CANVAS for interactive elements)
Each chapter is a clickable card; subchapters expand on click/hover
Synthetic data: Use generic names (e.g., “Module 1: AI Fundamentals”, “Module 2: Agentic AI”, etc.)
For each module, show:

Duration (weeks/months)
Format (online, workshop, labs)
Key topics (bulleted list)
Learning outcomes (bulleted list)
Example activities (synthetic, e.g., “Map a process”, “Design an agent”)
Assessment type (quiz, project, peer review)
Certification criteria (completion, capstone, feedback)
Time commitment summary (table or infographic)





Comparison Page:

Side-by-side view of both journeys (timeline, modules, outcomes)
Highlight differences in depth, duration, and focus



“Wow” Canvas Elements:

Animated transitions between chapters
Interactive infographics (e.g., progress bars, competency meters)
Hover effects, pop-up tooltips with synthetic examples
Custom icons for each module/phase
Responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile




2. Data Model (Synthetic Example)


AI Champion Journey:

5 Phases, 20+ modules, 12 months, 320–432 hours
Example modules: “AI Fundamentals”, “Process Mapping”, “Agent Design”, “Governance”, “Business Model Innovation”, “Capstone Project”
Each module: 1–3 weeks, 5–8 hours/week



Fast Track Journey:

5 modules, 11 weeks, 30–40 hours
Example modules: “AI Essentials”, “Agentic AI”, “Process Mapping”, “Governance”, “Business Model Innovation”




3. Visual & UX Requirements

Use CANVAS for all interactive timelines, cards, and infographics
Color palette: Vibrant, modern, high contrast
Typography: Bold headings, readable body text
Layout: Clean, spacious, intuitive navigation
Accessibility: Alt text for visuals, keyboard navigation


4. Instructions for the AI Tool

Ensure both journeys are fully represented, with clear differentiation
Prioritize “wow” factor in visuals and interactivity (see attached canvas for inspiration)
Template must be easily adaptable for future real data integration
Output should be ready for export/deployment as a standalone webpage


5. Example Synthetic Module (for reference)
JSON{  "module": "AI Fundamentals",  "duration": "2 weeks",  "format": "Self-paced online + workshops",  "key_topics": [    "What is AI/ML/LLM",    "Generative AI vs. traditional AI",    "Neural networks basics",    "AI reliability and bias"  ],  "learning_outcomes": [    "Define AI applications",    "Identify AI limitations",    "Articulate AI value to stakeholders"  ],  "assessment": "Quiz + project",  "certification": "Completion + capstone"}Show more lines
