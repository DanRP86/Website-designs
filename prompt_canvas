Create a hyperrealistic vertical poster of a futuristic Japanese city street at night, in heavy rain.

SUBJECT & COMPOSITION
- Viewpoint: eye-level, centered on a long, perfectly straight street that forms a strong one‑point linear perspective tunnel.
- Aspect ratio: tall poster, 4:5 or 9:16 vertical.
- In the center of the street, a single human figure stands with an umbrella, seen from behind, small but clearly silhouetted. The person is anonymous and not the main focus, more of an anchor in the scene.
- The street is narrow and flanked by mid‑rise buildings on both sides, forming a canyon of architecture. No cars.
- The composition must feel very orderly and controlled, like a carefully engineered corridor of light.

MOOD & ATMOSPHERE
- Time: deep night, during steady rain.
- Mood: cold, quiet, contemplative, almost clinical. The city feels alive with information, but emotionally distant.
- The air contains subtle rain streaks, light mist and very soft bloom around lights, but overall the image is crisp and clean, not foggy.

COLOR & LIGHTING (COLDER, MORE FUTURISTIC)
- Palette is dominated by cold blues and cyans only:
  - near-black midnight blues for the sky and deepest shadows,
  - dark steel-blue for the facades,
  - bright cyan and electric ice-blue for neon lights and reflections.
- Avoid warm colors such as orange, yellow, or red; if any warmth appears, it should be extremely minimal.
- Light sources are mainly vertical neon signs and glowing panels on the buildings.
- Neon light reflects sharply on the wet pavement tiles, creating long, straight streaks of cyan.
- The lighting should feel like high-end sci‑fi city photography: high dynamic range, deep blacks, and precise highlights.

ARCHITECTURE & SHAPES (MORE LINEAR, NON-CURVED)
- Architecture is very rectilinear and geometric: facades made of panels, frames, and windows aligned on a grid.
- Avoid curved shapes in the environment. No arches, no rounded signs, no rounded windows.
- Signs are rectangular light boxes, vertical banners and horizontal panels with straight edges. Cables and conduits should be straight or gently angled, not looping.
- Sidewalk edges, building corners, window frames and floor tiles should be clearly defined straight lines.

TYPOGRAPHY & DENSITY (MORE DENSE, MORE TYPOGRAPHIC)
- The scene is dense with vertical Japanese signs and typographic panels on both sides of the street, stacked from ground floor up several stories.
- Text content:
  - Primarily Japanese characters (kanji, katakana), large and glowing on vertical signs.
  - A few simple English or romaji words such as “KARAOKE” or “SAKE” can appear on some panels.
  - Include a few numeric codes like “0110” or “2046” in small panels for a technological feel.
- The typography should feel like a grid of information: repeated vertical signs at regular intervals, with smaller auxiliary labels and numbers.
- Text is legible but not the main story; it is treated as a visual pattern of glowing strokes.
- The overall feeling is “information-dense”: many signs and panels, but still carefully organized so the viewer is not overwhelmed.

HYPERREALISM & DETAIL
- Style: ultra-detailed, hyperrealistic, close to a high-resolution photograph or a very high-end 3D cinematic render.
- Surfaces:
  - Wet asphalt or tiled pavement with sharp reflections and tiny puddles.
  - Glass windows with subtle interior hints (faint reflections, silhouettes, faint light inside).
  - Metal frames and shutters with realistic wear, but kept relatively clean and modern.
- Show fine details such as:
  - rain droplets and thin streaks of rain catching the neon light,
  - subtle texture on building panels and doors,
  - tiny light variations inside windows and behind frosted glass.
- The umbrella and the coat of the central figure should also show realistic specular highlights from the neon lights.

PERSPECTIVE & DEPTH
- Strong one‑point perspective: all major lines (street edges, building edges, window rows) converge to a single vanishing point in the distance.
- In the far distance, the corridor continues with more tiny neon signs and windows, fading gradually into atmospheric perspective (slightly lighter blue, slightly desaturated).
- The central figure stands exactly on the perspective axis, with their reflection mirrored below on the wet ground.

CAMERA & FRAMING
- Camera height roughly at the figure’s shoulder level, as if the viewer is standing behind them at a short distance.
- Focal length: slightly telephoto, compressing the scene a bit so the sides feel close and the corridor feels long and tight.
- Depth of field: mostly sharp across the scene; you can add a very gentle falloff in the distant background, but avoid heavy blur. Prioritize clarity and readability of lines.

OVERALL ART DIRECTION
- Make the image feel like a museum-quality poster: extremely polished, meticulously composed, and highly intentional in every detail.
- No visible noise or AI artifacts. No surreal distortions.
- The scene should look as if an expert city photographer or high-end concept artist spent countless hours refining the composition, lighting, and details by hand.
- Keep the design language minimal and disciplined: cold colors, straight lines, dense but structured signage, and very subtle atmospheric effects.
- Final result: a cold, futuristic, hyperrealistic Japanese neon street, very dense with typography and linear architecture, captured in a tall vertical poster that feels cinematic, precise, and crafted with master-level attention to detail.
